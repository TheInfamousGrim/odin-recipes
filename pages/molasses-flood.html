        <h1>Boston's Great Molasses Flood of 1919: A Not so Sweet Demise</h1>
        <img src="../images/good_boy_molasses.jpg" alt="Two pictures, one on top of the other.
        The picture on the top shows a wry looking Shiba-Inu composited onto a boston street. There is meme like top and bottom text above and below the dog.
        The top text says 'OH BOY'. The bottom text says 'I SURE DO LOVE WALKING THROUGH NORTH END NEIGHBOURHOOD IN BOSTON ON JANUARY 15, 1919.'.
        The bottom image is the same boston street background with a now quite frightened and angry looking Shiba-Inu with Top text above it.
        The top text says 'WAIT WHY DO I SMELL MOLASSES.'">

        <h3>So How Do we Get That Panicked Molasses Goodness?</h3>
        <p>Usually the saccharine molasses (or black treacle as we british folk would call it) is associated with all things sugar, spice and everything nice (and rum of course).</p>
        <p>As much of a downer as it may be, this isn't one of those stories about the creation of the powerpuff girls. 
            This is more to do with the creation of a molten sugar death wave, that wreaks more havoc than Mariah Carey at an Easter Party.</p>
        <p>"Boo! What a buzz kill! I want bubbles pounding on Mojo Jojo's oversized brain!". I know, I know; we all love a bit of powerpuff beatdown. But life's full of dissapoitnments, get used to it bubs.
             So you're gonna get a mass of sweetness that creates untold destruction, alright? ya frickin jabroni you.</p>
