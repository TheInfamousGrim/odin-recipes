        <p><b>Uh oh, looks like Pepsi's been on the ole Dr. Pepper again...</b></p>
        <img src="../images/sorry_emilia_pepsi.jpg" alt="Another screen capture; this time an intrepid tweeter named Emilia replies saying her and her kids love it cold. 
        Pepsi responds aghast that she's been feeding such slurry to children.">
        <p><b>Well looks like emilia and her kids ain't seeing the sun rise.</b></p>
        <img src="../images/pepsi_breakdown.jpg" alt="Pepsi breaks down, screaming profanities about how anyone could be so callous as to drink unsanitized pepsi.
        Finally, with expletively laden text, they plead for everyone who's recently drank pepsi to get to the hospital immediately (That means you too!).">
        <p><b>Damn, I want what Pepsi's on...</b></p>

        <h3>Time to Make a Juicy Environmental Non-Hazard...ISH!</h3>
        <p>This is more of a fun disaster, the kind where you chuck your kid into a paddling pool of pomegranate juice.
            Except the kid is more like a couple of folks who suffered minor injuries and the paddling pool is 2.1 million Hubble-barns of cherry, pineapple, tangerine and orange juice.</p>
        <p>But I digress! So if you're looking for a mildly inconvenient disaster that's gonna leave a whole bunch of fish feeling all kinds of fruity then this is a disaster for you!</p>
        
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>28 million litres of cherry, pineapple, tangerine and orange juice. 
                And pomegranater juice! Apparently it can cure cancer as well as erectile dysfunction!</li>
            <li>A warehouse with a leaky roof. Drip, drip motherfucker.</li>
            <li>A russian PepsiCo subsiduary called Lebedyansky. God damned Americans screwing with those russians!</li>
            <li>Forget those puny humans, you need lots of fish! Remember fish don't feel pain, so it's ok to mess with them?
                Right? RIGHT????</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Recipe</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill the warehouse full to the brim with juices galore!</li>
            <li>Make that roof of the warehouse go leaky poo, so it's ready to collapse.</li>
            <li>With your godly psychic powers, will the whole place to come tumbling down releasing an ungodly torrent of pomegranete.</li>
            <li>Watch as that precious turgid red nectar cascades towards its fishy friends.</li>
            <li>Bask in the glory of the red fluid imbibing its essence into the fish.</li>
            <li>The fish are now cancer free and ready to bone hooray! It's a miraculous disaster after all.</li>
        </ol>
